text = "Platform engineer with 6+ years building and scaling infrastructure for AI/ML workloads and high-traffic production systems. I've led migrations from legacy stacks to modern Kubernetes platforms, built GitOps-driven CI/CD pipelines, and managed cloud infrastructure across AWS, Azure, and GCP. I use Go and Python when I need custom tooling, and I'm comfortable working across the full stack: from Terragrunt modules to Helm charts to Kubernetes Controllers."
